### Hi there!

My name is Cait, I'm an app developer and designer based in NYC. 

I've worked in-house for Columbia University and The Whitney Museum of American Art using Ruby on Rails, Drupal, and Vue.js. I've also enjoyed building my own apps in Express.js, React, Django. As an artist and technologiest, I'm passionate about bringing great design to digital media; in turn, I'm currently looking for software engineering roles that bridge the design and development teams.
