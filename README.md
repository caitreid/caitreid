### Hi there!

My name is Cait, I'm a software engineer and designer based in NYC. 

I've worked in-house for Columbia University, The Whitney Museum of American Art & The University of Washington using Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, and Vue.js. I've also enjoyed building my own apps in Express.js, React, Django. Currently I'm a developer for Wirecutter at The New York Times.
