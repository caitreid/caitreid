### Hi there!

My name is Cait, I'm an app developer and designer based in NYC. 

I've worked in-house for Columbia University and The Whitney Museum of American Art. I've worked professionally in Ruby on Rails, Drupal, and Vue.js, building my own apps in Express.js, React, Django. I'm currently looking for roles that lie at the intersection of design and development.

To get in touch, please reach out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-reid/).
